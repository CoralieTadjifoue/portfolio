A secret key is randomly generated, influencing the form, position, and weight of displayed blocks\n5. The encrypted message is obtained by combining the ternary code with the key (rotations, sums, multiplications, etc.)\n6. The game board shows two block sets: key blocks on top, encrypted message blocks on bottom\n7. The player manipulates blocks (horizontal moves, color change, drop, etc.) to align the encrypted message\n8. End condition is reached when all encrypted elements are reduced to one of the simple states (-1,0,+1)" }
